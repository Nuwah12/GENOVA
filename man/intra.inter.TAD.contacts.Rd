\usage{
intra.inter.TAD.contacts(exp, TAD, max.neighbor = 10, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{The Hi-C experiment object of a sample: produced by construct.experiment().}

\item{TAD}{A bed-dataframe. TADs should be consequtive (i.e. the 3' border of TAD1 is the 5' border of TAD2). This means that using TAD-calls from Arrowhead is only possible after some removing these internal sub-TADs.}

\item{max.neighbor}{How many surrounding TADs should be taken into account?}
}
\value{
A list containing a dataframe with scores between two TADs and an updated version of the TAD-input file, which now also includes TAD-IDs.
}
\description{
Combine a bed file with TAD positions and the Hi-C matrix file to calculate the average coverage over a TAD and between two TADs.
}
